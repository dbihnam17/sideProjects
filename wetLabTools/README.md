### `chooseYourOwnAdventure.py`
- Originally was a flow chart the lab called "Choose your own adventure"
- We would use FACS cell sorting to separate CD5+/CD19+ tumor B cells from CD19- non-tumor cells (germlines) before preparing for sequencing
- After isolating these populations, the sequencing assays we could run were determined by the number of cells we had, and the needs of the specific project
- This script is a quick way to save time from finding and looking over the flow chart, and just get a quick answer based on the standards we had set
- Some project names have been anonymized to prevent leaking confidential information
- This script is likely not useful to others since it is so specific to our lab, but is just meant to showcase some old Python scripting
